poetry is the package manager of python. 
execute poetry shell inside poetryenv folder to create a shell within the virtual env, then cd back to 05 python and execute python3 main.py to run the file.
use it instead of virtualenv . because of dependency management 
use poetry add to add packages to not install the dependencies globally.
